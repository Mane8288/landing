### Installing the base game (BO2)

This section will cover downloading a copy of BO2. Please skip this section if you already have a copy of the game.

**Please note we highly recommend buying the game if you do not own it, it is the best way to get a copy of the game files that are up to date and not corrupt or changed in some way. Key sites will give you a decent discount.**

1. From the windows file explorer navigate to My PC, then to **Local Disc (C:)** and create a new folder called `Games`

### Installing the DLCs (BO2)

<Alert variant="warning">

If you installed the game via the torrent from the instructions above then [skip to the setup in the launcher](#setting-up-t6-with-the-plutonium-launcher).  
**This is only for people who use their Steam files, but do not own any DLC**.  
This only downloads the DLC maps. You cannot play the game only with these files. If you want to download the game then [read above](#installing-the-base-game-bo2)!  
Keep in mind that if a server rotates a DLC map and you don't have them installed you will be kicked so if you can it's probably better to install them.  

</Alert>

1. Download/open your favourite torrent software.
qBittorent Windows x64 is recommended: [https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html](https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html)

2. Download the [torrent file](/t6_dlcs.torrent).

3. Open the torrent file `t6_dlcs.torrent` (from the previous step) it will open up your torrent client program and ask you where you'd like to save the DLCs.

### Setting up T6 with the Plutonium Launcher

Navigate to Black Ops 2, click on **SETUP** and then select your Black Ops 2 game folder.  
The folder you need to select is most likely either called `pluto_t6_full_game` or `Call of Duty Black Ops II`.  
Do not select your Games folder or your Document folders. **Select the folder with Black Ops II files in it!**

![Launcher set-up 1](/images/docs/install/5FOePMY.png)

* **If you are using a Steam copy it will be in this location:** `{Drive letter}\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops 2`

* **If you are using the torrent it will be in a folder named** `pluto_t6_full_game`
![Launcher set-up 2](/images/docs/install/hdjiIhN.png)

**(If you ever need to reselect the game folder, simply click on Game Settings next to the PLAY button)**
![Launcher reselect hint](/images/docs/install/MnkAcr8.png)

For those struggling to locate your game folder, this is what the contents of the game folder will look like:

![Completed Game Folder](/images/docs/install/B8g1bXI.png)

### T6 Error: Invalid Game Path

If you get this error then the folder that you selected during the setup doesn't contain the game files.  

![img](/images/docs/install/46KPMDc.png)

If you get this error then this means you selected your entire disk instead of the game folder.  
`C:\` is not your Black Ops II folder.

![img](/images/docs/install/error-401.png)

In both cases, the way to fix this issue is to click on Game settings in the launcher and to select the folder that contains the Black Ops II files.  
If you can't find it then read the [guide from the start](#t6-black-ops-2) again.

Congratulations you have completed the installation guide.

To launch BO2 simply open the Plutonium launcher and select PLAY.
